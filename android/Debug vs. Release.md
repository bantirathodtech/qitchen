Debug vs. Release Builds: Code-Level Differences and Usage

Differences at the Code Level

Signing

Debug: Automatically signed with a default debug keystore (generated by Android Studio). No need for my-release-key.jks or key.properties.

In build.gradle, the debug build type (implicitly defined) uses this default signing.

Release: Signed with your custom keystore (my-release-key.jks) via the signingConfigs.release block in build.gradle.

Optimization

Debug:

No minification or resource shrinking (minifyEnabled false, shrinkResources false implicitly).

Larger APK size, includes debugging symbols.

Release:

Minification and resource shrinking enabled (minifyEnabled true, shrinkResources true).

Smaller APK size, optimized for performance, removes unused code/resources via ProGuard.

ProGuard Rules

Debug: Not applied (no obfuscation or optimization).

Release: Applies rules from proguard-rules.pro (e.g., keeps Razorpay classes).

Assertions and Logging

Debug:

Dart assertions (assert) and debug logs (e.g., print) are active.

Example: assert(condition) in your Flutter code runs in debug mode.

Release:

Assertions are disabled, and print statements are ignored.

Example: assert(condition) has no effect in release mode.

Build Flags

In your Flutter code, you can use kDebugMode and kReleaseMode constants:

import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';

void main() {
if (kDebugMode) {
print("Running in debug mode"); // Only prints in debug
}
if (kReleaseMode) {
print("Running in release mode"); // Only prints in release
}
}

Usage

Debug Build

Purpose: Development and testing.

How: Run flutter run or flutter build apk --debug.

Where: Used on emulators/devices during development. Not suitable for sharing or Play Store.

File: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk.

Release Build

Purpose: Production and distribution.

How: Run flutter build apk --release.

Where: Shared with clients, testers, or uploaded to Google Play Store.

File: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk.

Verification

All files are now updated and correctly structured.

The build.gradle includes the signing config, which was missing in your original version.

Each file is in its proper place (e.g., key.properties is separate, ProGuard rules are in proguard-rules.pro).

Next Steps

Build the Release APK:

flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release

Test:

Install app-release.apk on an Android device.
